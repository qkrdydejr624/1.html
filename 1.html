<h3>Surface and paint damage repair</h3>
<p>Transport, assembly, dynamic loads, dust particles, unfavourable weather conditions and any other negative environmental impact
may cause damage to the surface coating of the rotor blades (paint cracks, paint flaking, etc.).</p>
<p>These instructions describe how to carry out paint repairs. If damage is detected in the leading edge (erosion) area of the rotor blade,
proceed as described in instructions <strong>TD-esc-07-ger-xxx-10-004.</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to read and understand all safety instructions before commencing work.</p>
